    "Spam refers to unwanted email, often in the form of advertisements. In the literature, an email that is **not** spam is called *ham*. Most email providers offer automatic spam filtering, where spam emails will be moved to a separate inbox based on their contents. Of course this requires being able to scan an email and determine whether it is spam or ham, a classification problem. \n",

    "You are welcome to use tools from libraries such as `numpy` and `scipy` to write your classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while you may use tools such as the `cdist` function above, you **can not** import code which builds entire models. This includes but is not limited to use of a library like `scikit-learn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is described below and has 1000 rows. There is also a 500 row set of test data. These are functionally identical to the training data, they are just in a separate csv file to encourage you to split out your training and test data. You should consider how to best make use of all available data without overfitting and may wish to consider tools such as cross validation. This might be used, for example, to help decide what value of $k$ to use for k-nearest neighbour."
